The UDF performs the following steps:


It defines some macros that represent user inputs and constants for the simulation.
It defines some user-defined functions that return various properties and diffusivities of the nanofluid and the nanoparticle.
It defines some user-defined functions that return source terms for different equations that account for various effects such as buoyancy, thermophoresis, Brownian motion, Dufour effect, and Soret effect.
It uses some user-defined scalars (UDS) to store intermediate values such as volume fraction, temperature gradient, salinity gradient, etc.

The UDF can be used to model nanofluid flows with heat and mass transfer, such as solar collectors, heat exchangers, or cooling systems. The UDF also demonstrates how to use macros, aliases, and user-defined functions in Fluent UDFs.
